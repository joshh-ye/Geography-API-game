## Features

- Simple and grounded geography quiz
- Hint function that leads to google image of an answer

Project feedback: My first API project. Special thanks to the React, TypeScript, and W3Schools documentation for guiding me through this project.

If given more time: with more time, the hint feature would have been much more developed, pulling up an actual google image of the answer and setting it as the background.

Thank you for using my web API!
